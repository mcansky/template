So a team should have a reference style guide to help everyone from the new comer to the seasoned veteran to write code that is readable and easily reviewed by the rest of the team.

Below are links to different languages style guides. Pick the stuff you need, use a linter to get most of the work of enforcement done automatically and keep writing code.

## Ruby

There is a great start at [Rubystyle.guide](https://rubystyle.guide).

## Python

There is a great start with [Pep 8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/).

## Javascript

Top hit for JS is [Airbnb's one](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript).

## Elixir

Top hit for Elixir is [christopheradams'](https://github.com/christopheradams/elixir_style_guide).
