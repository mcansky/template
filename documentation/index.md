This is the documentation for your service and, or, team.

## Extending

You can just add more markdown files in the documentation folder and they will be picked up and available, without restart on [http://doc.myteam.local:8000](http://doc.myteam.local:8000) if you followed the steps described in the README.

They should use the `default` layout and you can adjust the nav order to your liking.

You can checkout Jekyll's [Just-the-docs theme page](https://pmarsceill.github.io/just-the-docs/) for more details on how to use the just-the-docs template for jekyll.
