We use git, git is used.

## Pick a flow

If you are unsure about how to proceed with a specific branching model you can pick from a few documented ones :
- The "gitflow" introduced by Vincent Driessen in his post [A successful Git branching model](https://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/).
- The "github flow" described by Scott Chacon : [GitHub Flow](http://scottchacon.com/2011/08/31/github-flow.html)
- The "gitlab flow" introduced by Sid Sijbrandij : [11 rules of Gitlab Flow](https://about.gitlab.com/blog/2016/07/27/the-11-rules-of-gitlab-flow/)

If you want to read more on the topic Patrick Porto listed those above and a few more in his post [4 branching workflows for git](https://medium.com/@patrickporto/4-branching-workflows-for-git-30d0aaee7bf).

## If Github

If you use Github know that there is a way to include Pull Requests and Issues templates within the repository and have Github use them as basis when people create any Pull Request or Issue.

- [Pull request template](https://help.github.com/en/github/building-a-strong-community/creating-a-pull-request-template-for-your-repository)
- [Issue template](https://help.github.com/en/github/building-a-strong-community/configuring-issue-templates-for-your-repository)

## If Gitlab

Gitlab also supports pull requests and issues templates, in a very similar fashion as to Github. [Description templates](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/description_templates.html#using-the-templates).
