This is the documentation for your service and, or, team.

## Extending

You can just add more markdown files in the documentation folder and they will be picked up and available, without restart on http://doc.<your_chosen_domain>.local:8000 .

They should use the `default` layout and you can adjust the nav order to your liking.

You can checkout https://pmarsceill.github.io/just-the-docs/ for more details on how to use the just-the-docs template for jekyll
